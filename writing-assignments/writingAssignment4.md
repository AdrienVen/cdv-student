Critical Data and Visualization

03/13/2021

The first example of a predictive system I can think of is Netflix’s recommendation algorithm. Indeed, the app’s system is designed to analyze your data, predict which shows, descriptions and stills are the most likely to make you click, and then present those to you. A second example I like particularly is the trajectory prediction in video games. In some games, enemies are smart enough to not attack where you are, but where you’re going to be. Of course AI are not meant to frustrate the player, and they don’t have a lot of data to go off of so changing course is often enough to evade them. Finally some financial institutions make frequent use of risk-management/modelling algorithms, when they consider giving out or loan for example. Your data is processed by a computer, and depending on its outcome, you may or may not be given the chance to buy your dream house. For those on the good side of them, predictive systems may seem like a net positive, yet as Philip K. Dick’s The Minority Report shows there are insidious downsides to them.

While the work dabbles equally in science fiction and futurism, its predictive algorithm is loosely based on the very real machine learning ensemble methods. Indeed, where most machine learning algorithms use all of a dataset to train one learner, ensemble methods propose to train a set of learners, and use them collectively as a stronger, diversified learner. In this case, we can consider the individual prescient mutants as the individual learners, and their consensus as the strong learner. What is interesting about their case is that the mutants seem to be equally a frightening description of algorithmic coldness and human apathy. Like our computers the mutants constantly produce names of would-be murders without a shred of emotion. But much like us, the “idiots” babble data “All day long” (Dick), which is then collected and used independently of their will. Embracing that data as truth, many of the characters are seen doubting or outright rejecting their own critical thinking skills, which I believe is a great depiction of what overreliance on predictive data could bring: the inability to exert our own judgement when the situation calls for it, such as matters of life, death, love or justice.
