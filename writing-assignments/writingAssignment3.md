Critical Data & Visualization

One thing that particularly surprised me in Zuboff’s discussion of the ideas present in the book was the idea that the
US government deliberately chose to buffer tech companies like Google from the law. This resulted in a severe
lack of transparency in how both the technology companies and the US government obtained and used this data.
Likewise, I was shocked to discover that the technological capabilities of intelligence and defense agencies
were struggling to keep up with Google and other tech companies. Indeed, having advanced technology in the hands of
a government agency is worrisome, but ultimately these are still bound by matters of sovereignty and 
their country's rule of law. Companies on the other hand are only bound by the rules which apply to corporations,
and are free to implant themselves on any part of the globe, a real pipe-dream for intelligence services. 
In that context, surveillance capitalism refers to an economy which is based on the commercialization 
of predictive models based on data collected by software services. Companies engaging in this business model not only 
collect and model data, but also actively attempt to generate data which fits their models by influencing users. 
This naturally raises huge concerns about our intellectual freedom, as software services such as social media 
or internet browsers can become devastating tools of mass manipulation and surveillance. One thing I am curious about is 
wouldn’t tech companies start punishing their users (e.g. slower functionalities, less innovation etc...) 
if they were targeted by legislation? Is there a way to not destroy this surveillance capitalism, but render it fair and equitable?
