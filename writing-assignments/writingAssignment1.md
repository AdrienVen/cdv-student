Data Finds A Way

While Critical Questions for Big Data raises some very important questions and points, it fails in a big way to target one critical audience: the developer and programmer community. The people writing the code are more often than not the minds behind the algorithms and tools that ushered in this Big Data era. And yet those people might be the least likely to think critically about their work. Much like the scientists in Jurassic Park, they spend so much time thinking about if they could, that they completely forget to ask whether they should. The results are plain to see: advertising that seeps ever deeper into our lives, social media and websites that use the human psyche’s weaknesses to keep them hooked etc. This is extremely visible in Anderson’s quote, where he asserts that we can “[f]orget taxonomy, ontology and psychology” (Anderson, 2008). Though it is quite extreme, this is a very good example of the mentality of the coding community. Despite its supportiveness, it remains an extremely meritocratic community, where members would much rather use the optimal solution than the most ethic. It is this sort of mentality for example that drove the creation of infinite scrolling, which is now a fixture of virtually all social media, and a timesink people unwittingly dive in, sometimes multiple times a day. For that reason, I believe that works such as Critical Questions for Big Data are extremely important, as they push the issue of morality in code onto the table. By failing to address the coding community however, the paper most likely loses some of its potential impact. Unless we manage to convince the builders and architects of the Big Data era, I doubt we will be able to make any serious changes.
