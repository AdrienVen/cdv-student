It is known in the meteorite community for hosting the Tucson Mineral and Gems show,  by far the largest meteorite trading event in the world.  The desert environment being suited for meteorite hunting, and the American South being historically associated with space and astronomy were all factors in making this town the meteorite capital of the United States."
