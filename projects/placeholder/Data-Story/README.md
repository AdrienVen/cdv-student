## 2.057 million dollars.
That's how much the Fukang meteorite, one of the largest Pallasite Meteorites found on Earth sold for.
The space rock is a harbinger of a network of hunters, traders and hubs which deal in the collection,
and selling of meteorites for ... astronomical prices. By [pulling information from various articles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jNY-OhmdoZfAS8rDmqn9wQOl3BCzC2ty-HyoNN8oS10/edit?usp=sharing) and 
[one dataset from NASA](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings), this website sets you on a meteoritic path to finding your first high-selling piece of space.

# About the viz
Having to deal with with multiple locations on earth, it was really important for me that
the viewer gets a good idea of where each location is in relation to each other. How spread out
and international the meteorite hunting business really is. This is why the maps, both rectangular
and the globe were chosen, as user can tell at a glance how diverse the locations (and people!) are.


The Visualizations show that meteorites are mostly found in remote or desert-like regions, which I think
makes sense given how relatively easy it is to forage for them in those kinds of areas. They also show that buyers have
a preference for three types of meteorites: Pallasite, Lunar and Iron meteorites. One compromise I've had to make
was to give up on placing all the descriptions I wrote in the visualizations. The hubs already use enough tooltips,
and I feared any more text would lose the viewer. Finally if I had more time I'd dedicate it to giving the
website a more space-like feel: maybe with some twinkling stars and passing asteroids!
