# SPACE DATASET!

![](Presentation/source.gif)

I managed to get my hands on a dataset which lists the various Meteorite landings
since 1880. I could see myself building an interactive earth model 
allowing you to see where the meteorite landed, or view data about it such as its mass,
or even the energy it had!

## GDP Per Capita $$$

I found a dataset from the worldbank organization which contains
the gdp per capita of many countries since 1990. This could be used
for some interesting visualization a la Exercise 5 of how the nations
gdp per capita has increased, or how the gap between countries
has widened. I could think of creative ways of representing this,
such as scaled stacks of bills for example!

## Moma Artworks Dataset

A dataset listing more than 15K artworks along with their artist, date,
medium and nationality. Here I am thinking of maybe comparing different
periods / countries in terms of art output, maybe even play a little bit
with the artwork thumbnails with some trusty Python software!
