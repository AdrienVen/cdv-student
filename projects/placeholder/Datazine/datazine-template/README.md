##For my Datazine project,
I decided to keep track of all the songs I ended up thinking about or singing.
I did so by creating a google form where I recorded the song's name/artist, the genre of the song,
what I was doing at the time and whether I sang it or not.

##To me,
once an earworm has wriggled its way into my head, it's as if it becomes part of my imagination,
forever tethered to my brain until I need, (or want!) to pull that song from up there and give it sound or thought.

##In the visualization,
you will notice that my favorite genres are Pop and Hip Hop, which isn't all that surprising
considering they represent the biggest part of the music I listen to. One interesting take away however,
is that I seem to be more prone to think about a song when I am working or doing chores. This leads me
to think that I use these songs to motivate myself and stay focused. Funny enough, I think my mom does that as well!

One crucial compromise I had to make was to not include a visualization for the song titles/artists.
At 30 songs strong, virtually all of them unique, I saw few options to make an interesting visualization
without cluttering the display or affecting the color palette.

##I would have loved to add
A play button on each of the little bubbles, so that a visitor could play the song in their browser. I almost figured
out how to work the spotify API to do so, but sadly ran out of time to implement it.

In addtion, I think organizing the songs in a force graph and allowing a visitor to create playlists from the different
organizations (genre, activity, singing), would have been really interesting!
